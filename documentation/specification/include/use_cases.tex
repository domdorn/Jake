\section{Terms and definitions, Fields}
\begin{description}

\item[ID] Unique \emph{ID} of the use case. Once set, it is immutable.
\item[Name] Descriptive name of the use case. It should be short yet long enough to describe the use case.
\item[Scope] The scope of the use case, e.g \emph{per project, per file, etc}. The scope may be chained together like \emph{per project: per file}.
\item[Summary] Short summary of the use case.
\item[Goal/Rationale] The \emph{goal} and the \emph{rationale} of the use case. What's its goal and why does it matter to the user.
\item[Preconditions] Preconditions of the use case that must be met in order to perform this use case.
\item[Triggers] Triggers that kick-start the use case.
\item[Primary Scenario] The basic course of events.
\item[Alternative Path] Deviating paths from the basic course of events.
\item[Postconditions] Conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed.
\item[Frequency of use] How often the use case will be used. This field is based on a wild guess and is usually something like, \emph{daily, weekly, monthly, etc}.
\item[See also] References to other use cases or other related information, e.g. \emph{log in} refers to \emph{log out} and vice versa.
