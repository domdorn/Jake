        Jake and others

Difference between Jake and existing solutions

  First we can make a distinction into

  [[a]] data replication / mirroring

         This means backup, copying into one direction. Only one actor is active.

         Examples for this category: Rsync, Dropbox

  [[b]] data synchronisation / version control

         This means multiple actors are active and there might be conflicts between versions.

         Examples for this category: Mercurial, git

         Jake is in this category.

Unique to Jake

  Looking for a product that provides version control and is

  * Secure

  * Open source

  * Cross-platform

  * Server-less

  What products are out there?

  We only know complex and clunky ones.

  Maybe you know others?


Jake vs. Version control systems like svn, cvs, git, hg, ...

   Jake does not keep old revisions itself, but keeps only a history of who did change what.
   Thus it is not as powerful as these tools.

   Jake however has zero setup effort, and does not need you to have a central server.

   Jake is not intended for software developers, but for the average office
   computer user of other professions.

   Jake intends to be hassle-free, easy to use and obvious.

Jake vs. "Cloud services" such as Dropbox

   Jake is distributed and does not have a central storage.
   This solves many security concerns and dependencies.

   There are privacy concerns attached to putting your data into
   someone elses hands.

   It is very difficult for a company to prove their
   systems are secure. This is especially true
   when their software is not open source.

   Jake is safer since the data is not stored on a server, but only at
   the clients.
