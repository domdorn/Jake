Technical features

  Jake is a client application for collaboratively working on a folder.

  Here is an indepth explanation of how Jake works.

* Jake communication

** XMPP

   Jake connects to the XMPP/Google talk server where your account is
   and behaves similar to a IM client (but does not try to replace it).

   The smack library helps us with that.

** Peer-to-Peer File transfers

   File transfers between clients occur peer-to-peer (with the negotiation of IP addresses over XMPP), or, as a last resort.

   The ice4j library helps us with that.

** Smart File transfers

   Jake uses the same mechanisms as <rsync>, to only transmit changes in files. So if you change 1 byte in a 1GB file, only the change will be transmitted.

   The jarsync library helps us with that.
